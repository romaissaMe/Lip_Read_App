deploying the model using Streamlit   
Original Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01599   
## data as videos along with audio transcription  
data_url : 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YlvpDLix3S-U8fd-gqRwPcWXAXm8JwjL'  
## to convert mpg videos to mp4 format in order to be displayed in streamlit app it does require ffmpeg in os:
